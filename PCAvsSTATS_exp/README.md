# Experiments with PCA and spatial statistics

In this folder I grouped the notebooks where I compared the performance of Support Vector Regressors with 4 different input preprocessings.
Moreover, for each investigated basin, averaging window with various size (of 30, 15, 10 and 5 days) is carried out.
This analysis has been carried out before snow-grid data was made available.

The input data is available at: https://scientificnet.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/adoproject/Shared%20Documents/T2/Runoff_prediction/daily_input_nosnow?csf=1&web=1&e=PSREKv
