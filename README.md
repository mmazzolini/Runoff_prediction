# Runoff_prediction

This is the main repository for my job at EURAC.

Here you will find most of the code I wrote and you can visualize the results of the experiments that I carried out.

The datasets are available to Eurac users on the project repository (to be mounted on letter Z:) .. and at the following shared folder:
