This repo includes the notebooks where the hypertuning and training of each basin's model is carried out. Each station has a notebook that is named with the ADO DB code (id_station).

The input dataset is produced with the code available at the file https://github.com/mmazzolini/Runoff_prediction/blob/0fc9213ba0dc94b9617b434ca7bf86bd211162cd/INPUT_PREPROCESSING_SVR.ipynb

The already processed input datasets are available in the folder: .....

The models are saved in the folder: https://scientificnet.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/adoproject/Shared%20Documents/T2/Runoff_prediction/models?csf=1&web=1&e=w1HPVA
